                            Hello! This is a generator for text fonts of the "cool" variety. I noticed people were
                            trying to find a generator like fancy letters, but were ending up on actual font sites
                            rather than generators of copy-paste text like this one. So currently this is basically a
                            duplicate of the above, but I think I'll try to collect a few more "cool" text fonts, like
                            the old enlgish one, and specialise this a bit. </div>
